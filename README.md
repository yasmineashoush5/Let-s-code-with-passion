# Portfolio
That's the name that I picked for my repo, which has my portfolio. My portfolio tells everything about me.
It contains my name, phone number, email, github, twitter and spotify accounts. I put a lot of effort and I worked so hard in that porfolio. I am trying to express how enthusiastic and energized am I for coding, and also I can't wait to show everybody, including the potential employer, my skills and how much I learned.

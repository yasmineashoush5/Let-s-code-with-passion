My name is Yasmine Mohamed. I am a Teacher Assistant, and through my teaching career, I learned to be patient, team player, creative, passionate, multi-tasking, and working under pressure . I love coding, and my dream is to become a full stack web developer. I love to learn new things everyday, especially new technologies. Although it is hard and challenging, but it will be unique and awesome when I reach the top of the mountain and fulfill my dreams by hard work and dedication . I am so excited to show everyone, including my potential employer,  my skills and how much I learned.
